        <h3> Why Full Body Workouts for Beginners? </h3>
        <p>Eciency: Full body workouts allow beginners to target multiple muscle groups in a single session, making the most of their time at the gym. <br> 
            Frequency: Since you're working each muscle group every session, you can train more frequently, promoting faster skill acquisition and muscle adaptation. <br> 
            Balanced Development: Full body workouts help prevent muscle imbalances, as all muscle groups are targeted consistently. <br> 
            Foundation Building: Beginners need to build a foundation of strength and endurance across their entire body. <br>
             Full body workouts are ideal for this purpose.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Importance of Proper Form:</h3>
        <p>Injury Prevention: Correct form minimizes the risk of injury. Learning the right techniques from the beginning sets a foundation for safe and eective training. <br>
             Muscle Engagement: Proper form ensures that you're targeting the intended muscle groups, maximizing the beneﬁts of each exercise. <br> 
             Long-Term Success: Developing good form early on establishes habits that contribute to long-term success and progress in your ﬁtness journey. <br> 
             Eciency: Performing exercises with the right form enhances the eciency of your workouts, leading to better results over time.
